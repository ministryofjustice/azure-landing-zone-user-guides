# What the team supports

The ALZ team provides support in a fourth line capacity. We will provide support for any elements provided as part of spoke handover and for any of our standard services that you have opted into using after handover. [Please refer to our page about what the ALZ does for more information on what is included with a spoke as standard.](/documentation/our_offer/howthealzworks/index.html)

## Examples of issues and requests we would help
 
- A VM application (app) or database (DB) fails to connect with another endpoint which has been configured 
- Our patching service is not using the patch arrangement we have setup e.g.  Azure Update Manager 
- You are unable to provision resources because of a policy violation e.g. name is not as per naming policy, trying to use a public IP address 
- Approved policy exemption implementation 
- You need to add a new route or peer from ALZ to somewhere 
- VMs that refuse to behave despite 3LS best efforts 
- You are unable to connect to your resources using our Bastion service 
- You no longer see monitoring traffic when using our solution in Prometheus 

**We do not support with any application level issues.** Please follow the established channels for reporting and resolving these (generally via ServiceNow).

## Azure landing Zone in ServiceNow

The Azure Landing Zone team managed incidents in ServiceNow. If an incident is deemed to be an issue with the Azure Landing Zone, it is likely to be a [major incident](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?sys_kb_id=8038660cdbea67401b4ffc45ae9619fa&id=kb_article_view&sysparm_rank=6&sysparm_tsqueryId=2e4d458c1b6d4550b51fdce3b24bcb62) and will be managed as such.

Our service offer in ServiceNow is *Azure landing Zone (MOJO)*

Our assignment group is *ALZ 4LS*

If you have general enquiries you can contact us [ALZDemand@justice.gov.uk](mailto:ALZDemand@justice.gov.uk)

## First, Second and Third Line Support Information

1LS, 2LS and 3LS teams have no responsibility towards managing ALZ but there may be cases which are caused by an issue in the ALZ. The ALZ has no 'direct' users; No one is going to call the help desk and say, “I’ve got an issue with or I can’t log into the Azure Landing Zone“. There may be times when 3LS staff require direct support with the ALZ.

### Incidents
If one user or a small subset of users have an issue with an application then it is likely to be an application issue and, therefore, not for the ALZ team.
If the issue is impacting all application users then it “could” be an Azure Landing Zone issue. Azure Landing Zone is dependent on the underlying networks so issues may be a Network failure.
