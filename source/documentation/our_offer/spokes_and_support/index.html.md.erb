# What the team supports

We will provide support for any elements provided as part of spoke handover and for any of our standard services that you have opted into using after handover. [Please refer to our page about what the ALZ does for more information on what is included with a spoke as standard.](source/documentation/our_offer/How the ALZ works)

Examples of issues and requests we would help with are: 
 
- A VM application (app) or database (DB) fails to connect with another endpoint which has been configured 
- Our patching service is not using the patch arrangement we have setup e.g.  automation accounts and update management 
- You are unable to provision resources because of a policy violation e.g. name is not as per naming policy, trying to use a public IP address 
- Approved policy exemption implementation 
- You need to add a new route or peer from ALZ to somewhere 
- VMs that refuse to behave despite 3LS best efforts 
- You are unable to connect to your resources using our Bastion service 
- You no longer see monitoring traffic when using our solution in Prometheus 

**We do not support with any application level issues.** Please follow the established channels for reporting and resolving these (generally via ServiceNow).
