# Observability for your workloads

Resources in ALZ are monitored using the in-built Azure Monitor. Azure Monitor is a collection of Azure services used to gather, parse and visualise log data and metrics from supported Azure resources.

As standard, the ALZ team deliver some Azure monitor components pre-configured as part of a Spoke or Workload, making it easier to get up and running with Azure Monitor.

As part of a standard Spoke or Workload, the ALZ team provide: 

- Log Analytics Workspace
- Data Collection Rule for use with [Azure Monitor Agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview)
- Keyvault log collection via Diagnostic Settings
- 2 Workbooks pre-configured for visualising useful metrics on: 
    - Virtual Machines
    - Core Spoke/Workload resources

To set up your monitoring, please see our [DIY guides](/documentation/diy/monitoringsetup/index.html)
