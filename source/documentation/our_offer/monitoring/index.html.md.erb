# ALZ Monitoring

Resources in ALZ are monitored using the in-built Azure Monitor. Azure Monitor is a collection of Azure services used to gather, parse and visualise log data and metrics from supported Azure resources.

As standard, the ALZ team deliver some Azure monitor components pre-configured as part of a Spoke or Workload, making it easier to get up and running with Azure Monitor.

## What does ALZ provide? 

As part of a standard Spoke or Workload, the ALZ team provide: 

- Log Analytics Workspace
- Data Collection Rule for use with [Azure Monitor Agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview)
- Keyvault log collection via Diagnostic Settings
- 2 Workbooks pre-configured for visualising useful metrics on: 
    - Virtual Machines
    - Core Spoke/Workload resources


## Monitoring a Virtual Machine

Here we'll walk through a common use-case where one or more Virtual Machines need to be monitored.


### Install the AMA (VM Built with ALZ VM Module)

1.) When passing your VM configuration to the [module](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/azure-landing-zone-user-guides/documentation/diy/build_vm/index.html), ensure that `monitor = true` is set on each VM that you wish to monitor. Setting this provisions the Azure Monitor Agent on the VM and associates it to the appropriate Data Collection Rule for your Spoke. 


### Install the AMA (VM Built any other way)

1.) Install the Azure Monitor Agent on the VM(s) you wish to monitor. There are a variety of ways to accomplish this but in the absence of a more automated method it can simply be enabled and installed using the Azure Portal. See the Microsoft documentation on installation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-manage?tabs=azure-portal#install)

During the installation process, you will be asked to create a Data Collection Rule. At this point, rather then creating a new one, you should use the existing Data Collection Rule that already exists in your Spoke. It's deployed as standard to all Spokes and is called `MSVMI-azure-monitor-agent`. Associating your Azure Monitor Agent install to this Data Collection Rule ensures that the logs it generated will be sent to the correct Log Analytics Workspace.

### Visualise the logs in a Dashboard

1.) Navigate to the [Azure Workbooks](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/microsoft.insights%2Fworkbooks) blade in the portal and locate the VM monitoring workbook for your Spoke. These workbooks are available to users who have reader writes on the Spoke subscription. The naming convention is as follows: 

`ALZ - VM Monitor <SPOKE_IDENTIFIER>`

For example, in the EUCS Spoke, the Workbook is called:

`ALZ - VM Monitor EUCS`

This workbook is pre-loaded with queries and can be used as a template by creating a new copy of it. It's not recommended to use this Workbook directly without first making a copy as it is maintained by the ALZ team and is defined in code. Any changes made to this via the Portal could be lost at any time without warning.

2.) Make a copy of this Workbook by opening it, selecting "Edit" and then selecting "Save As". Name it as you like and open this new copy of the Workbook. 

3.) From here, you can select the VM's you wish to monitor and which timespan you wish to visualise using the dropdown selectors at the top of the Workbook. This copied Workbook can be expanded to include new queries or metrics as needed. Once you've populated the dropdown selections, click the "Save" icon. 

## Monitoring something else

Anything that can send logs to a Log Analytics Workspace can be monitored using Azure Monitor. This includes most Azure resources and services, which can usually be configured with a series of "Diagnostic Settings" that specify which Log Analytics Workspace to send logs to and what kinds of event to send. Once logs are being collected, they can be queried and visualised using a Workbook.

## Alerting

Alerts in Azure can be configured using thresholds on Metric values or query results, which makes them easy to use in conjunction with resources that are sending logs to a Log Analytics Workspace. Once configured, they are linked to an Action Group which then determines what action to take (Send an email or SMS, restart a server etc...)

At current time, ALZ do not provide any alerts on a Spoke as standard due to the bespoke nature of defining an alert threshold. Often, useful alerting requires application or service specific knowledge to configure.


## Coming soon

- Access for users who don't use the Azure Portal via PowerBI. In the meantime, you can get started with consuming ALZ logs in PowerBI immediately using [this documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-powerbi)
- Integration with ServiceNow for automatic creation and assignment of tickets
- Templated standard alerting that can be used as basis for more tailored alerts and actions
