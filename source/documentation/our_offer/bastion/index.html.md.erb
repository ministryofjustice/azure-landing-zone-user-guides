# Secure Access to your spoke

The ALZ Bastion Host allows access to any Virtual Machine or Virtual Machine Scale Set in the Azure Landing Zone from the comfort of your own device. It provides a much more secure way to access your resources than the traditional jump box approach.

There are two ways of accessing ALZ Bastion:

- Portal (web based)
- Native Client (installed onto your device)

For further details of getting started with Bastion in your spoke, please see our [DIY guides](/documentation/diy/bastionsetup/index.html)
