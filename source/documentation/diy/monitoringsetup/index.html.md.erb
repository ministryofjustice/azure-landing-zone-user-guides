# Monitoring in the ALZ

Here we'll walk through a common use-case where one or more Virtual Machines need to be monitored.

##Monitoring a VM

### Install the AMA (VM Built with ALZ VM Module)

1.) When passing your VM configuration to the [module](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/azure-landing-zone-user-guides/documentation/diy/build_vm/index.html), ensure that `monitor = true` is set on each VM that you wish to monitor. Setting this provisions the Azure Monitor Agent on the VM and associates it to the appropriate Data Collection Rule for your Spoke. 


### Install the AMA (VM Built any other way)

1.) Install the Azure Monitor Agent on the VM(s) you wish to monitor. There are a variety of ways to accomplish this but in the absence of a more automated method it can simply be enabled and installed using the Azure Portal. See the Microsoft documentation on installation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-manage?tabs=azure-portal#install)

During the installation process, you will be asked to create a Data Collection Rule. At this point, rather then creating a new one, you should use the existing Data Collection Rule that already exists in your Spoke. It's deployed as standard to all Spokes and is called `MSVMI-azure-monitor-agent`. Associating your Azure Monitor Agent install to this Data Collection Rule ensures that the logs it generated will be sent to the correct Log Analytics Workspace.

### Visualise the logs in a Dashboard

1.) Navigate to the [Azure Workbooks](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/microsoft.insights%2Fworkbooks) blade in the portal and locate the VM monitoring workbook for your Spoke. These workbooks are available to users who have reader writes on the Spoke subscription. The naming convention is as follows: 

`ALZ - VM Monitor <SPOKE_IDENTIFIER>`

For example, in the EUCS Spoke, the Workbook is called:

`ALZ - VM Monitor EUCS`

This workbook is pre-loaded with queries and can be used as a template by creating a new copy of it. It's not recommended to use this Workbook directly without first making a copy as it is maintained by the ALZ team and is defined in code. Any changes made to this via the Portal could be lost at any time without warning.

2.) Make a copy of this Workbook by opening it, selecting "Edit" and then selecting "Save As". Name it as you like and open this new copy of the Workbook. 

3.) From here, you can select the VM's you wish to monitor and which timespan you wish to visualise using the dropdown selectors at the top of the Workbook. This copied Workbook can be expanded to include new queries or metrics as needed. Once you've populated the dropdown selections, click the "Save" icon. 

## Grant Read/view only access

In order for spoke owners to delegate the monitoring of their resources they can use a Built-in Azure RBAC group called **Monitoring Reader***. The members of this group get read only access to monitoring data. 

This role is available per spoke/workload.

Spoke owners by definition would have owner role on the spoke/workload so should be able to add/remove users into this Azure RBAC role.

Once a user is added to the **Monitoring Reader*** RBAC role , he/she will be able to login to Azure Portal and visualize the logs in the Dashboard created in the step above.

Steps:

1.) Login to Azure portal with an account which has owner rights on the spoke/workload
    Note: A workload very closely matches a subscription in Azure Landing Zone.

2.) Go to Subscriptions --> Access Control (IAM) --> Role assignments , Click Add and then click Add Role Assignment

3.) In the screen that follows , click Members and then click Select Members to find the user or user group to be delegated this right.

4.) Once selected click Next to close out the page. 

5.) Ask your users to logout and login back to Azure Portal to start viewing the Monitoring data.


## Monitoring something else

Anything that can send logs to a Log Analytics Workspace can be monitored using Azure Monitor. This includes most Azure resources and services, which can usually be configured with a series of "Diagnostic Settings" that specify which Log Analytics Workspace to send logs to and what kinds of event to send. Once logs are being collected, they can be queried and visualised using a Workbook.

## Alerting

Alerts in Azure can be configured using thresholds on Metric values or query results, which makes them easy to use in conjunction with resources that are sending logs to a Log Analytics Workspace. Once configured, they are linked to an Action Group which then determines what action to take (Send an email or SMS, restart a server etc...)

At current time, ALZ do not provide any alerts on a Spoke as standard due to the bespoke nature of defining an alert threshold. Often, useful alerting requires application or service specific knowledge to configure. 
  
The ALZ team maintain a Github repository [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-infrastructure-alz-monitor-alerts) that aims to centralise the configuration of alerting for all teams across all Workloads and environments in the Landing Zone. 


## Coming soon

- Access for users who don't use the Azure Portal via PowerBI. In the meantime, you can get started with consuming ALZ logs in PowerBI immediately using [this documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-powerbi)
- Integration with ServiceNow for automatic creation and assignment of tickets
- <del>Templated standard alerting that can be used as basis for more tailored alerts and actions </del>
