# ALZ Windows and Linux Virtual Machine backup facility

The ALZ patch repository [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-infrastructure-alz-backup) contains Terraform code for backing up virtual machines. The Terraform code in this repository creates backup policies in a specified Recovery Services vault and associates them with existing VMs. Each VM can be in a different resource group, and each VM can have its own backup policy. The backup policies are created separately and can be reused for multiple VMs.

## Pre-requisites

This configuration is intended for managing backups for existing VMs. The VMs and the Recovery Services vault should already exist in Azure.

## Quick-Start

- Clone this repository and create a new branch.
- Make amendments to the relevant files (fully explained below).
- Open a PR against `main`
- Wait  for a member of the ALZ team to approve and deploy.

## Usage

The configuration uses several input variables to customize the backup policies and VMs.
Users can specify the details of their VMs and backup policies in a the auto.tfvars files.

- `backup-policies.auto.tfvars`: This contains `backup_policies` which is a list of backup policies. Each item in the list is an object that specifies backup policy.

- `vm-backup-config.auto.tfvars`: This contains `vms` which is a A map where each key is a VM name, and each value is an object containing the resource group name and the backup policy name for that VM.

- `vault_resource_group_name`: The name of the resource group where the Recovery Services vault and backup policies are located.

- `vault_name`: The name of the Recovery Services vault.

## Core Files

This repository includes the following files:

`variables.tf`: Contains the declaration of variables used in the configuration.
`data.tf`: Contains data blocks to fetch information about existing resources, such as the Recovery Services vault and VMs.
`main.tf`: Contains the resource blocks to create the backup policies and associate them with VMs.
`versions.tf`: Contains the provider configuration.

## Full Usage

### Summary

## Configuration Files

There are two primary tfvars files that are used to drive the configurations:

- Backup Configuration (backup-policies.auto.tfvars): This file is responsible for defining the backup policies.
- VM Assignment (vm-backup-config.auto.tfvars): This file assigns specific backup policies to the desired virtual machines.

### Attribute Breakdown

### Backup Configuration (backup-policies.auto.tfvars)

This file defines the backup policies. Here's a brief overview of its attributes:

- `vault_resource_group_name`: The name of the resource group where the Recovery Services Vault resides.
- `vault_name`: The name of the Recovery Services Vault.
- `backup_policies`: A list of backup policies, where each policy can have attributes like name, frequency, retention days, etc.

- `Sample`

```
   vault_resource_group_name = "rg-hub-core-001"
   vault_name                = "rsv-hub-core-001"
   backup_policies = [...]
```

### VM Assignment ( vm-backup-config.auto.tfvars)

This file assigns the backup policies defined in the backup-policies.auto.tfvars to specific virtual machines. The attributes include

- `vms` : A map of virtual machines, where each VM can be associated with a specific backup policy.

- `Sample`

```
vms = {
  vm1 = {
    resource_group = "rg-hub-poltest-01"
    backup_policy  = "Policy-12-month-retention"
  }
  ...
}
```

## Monitoring and Alerting for Backups

Monitoring and alerting for backup jobs is accomplished via Azure Monitor. The Azure Landing Zone alerting repo found at [ALZ alerting repo](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-infrastructure-alz-monitor-alerts) has two sample backup alerts in the [Dev testing](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-infrastructure-alz-monitor-alerts/tree/main/terraform/environments/dev/testing) folder. Update the parameters in the backup alerts section of `custom-query-rules.auto.tfvars` file to configure alerts for your backup jobs.
