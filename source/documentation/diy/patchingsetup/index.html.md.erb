# ALZ Windows and Linux Virtual Machine patching facility

  

This repository contains Terraform code that allows spoke owners to create patch schedules (hereafter referred to as maintenance configurations) to patch their Windows and Linux  Operating  System based Virtual  Machines hosted in  Azure.

This is done via the update management center in  Azure.
Overview of the technology can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/update-center/scheduled-patching?tabs=schedule-updates-single-overview%2Cschedule-updates-scale-overview).

## Pre-requisites

  

The  VMS which will be added to the maintenance configurations will need to have their patch orchestration mode set to Azure  Orchestrated (Automatic  By  Platform).

  

This can be done either via portal [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/update-center/manage-update-settings?tabs=manage-single-overview%2Cmanage-scale-overview)

  

Or it can be specified as an option when you use the Azure  Landing  Zone  VM  Module [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-infrastructure-alz-terraform-vm) to create the vms.
