# Portal

To connect to a Windows Virtual Machine via RDP, see this [Document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-connect-vm-rdp-windows#rdp)

To connect to a Windows Virtual Machine via SSH using username/password authentication (not recommended), see this [Document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-connect-vm-ssh-windows#username)

Connection to a Windows Virtual Machine via SSH using a private key can be done in various ways:

- [Pasting private key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-connect-vm-ssh-windows#privatekey)
- [Using private key from local file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-connect-vm-ssh-windows#ssh)
- [Using private key from Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-connect-vm-ssh-windows#akv)

Note, that while the documentation refers to windows virtual machines, ssh authentication would work exactly the same way for Linux virtual machines

# Native Client

If you are connecting from a Windows machine to a windows virtual machine see
[this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/connect-native-client-windows#connect-windows).

If you are connecting from a Windows machine to a Linux virtual machine see [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/connect-native-client-windows#connect-linux)

If you are connecting from a *nix machine to a Windows/Linux virtual machine see [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/connect-native-client-windows#connect-tunnel)


See this helper script maintained by the ALZ team to simplify managing connections to multiple machines via the Native RDP client [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-infrastructure-azure-landing-zone-scripts/tree/main/connect-bastion)


# Connection scenarios

## Authentication with a local account

Login using a local account created on the Virtual machine in question using the portal or CLI.

Pre-requisites:

- An Azure AD Account that has the following RBAC permissions:
    - Reader role on the virtual machine.
    - Reader role on the NIC with private IP of the virtual machine.
    - Reader role on the Azure Bastion resource.


## Authentication with an Azure AD Account

Login using your Azure AD account using the portal or CLI. **Please note this only currently works in Production.**

Pre-requisites:

- An Azure AD Account that has the following RBAC permissions:
    - Either Virtual Machine Administrator Login or Virtual Machine User Login role on the virtual machine
    - Reader role on the NIC with private IP of the virtual machine.
    - Reader role on the Azure Bastion resource.


## Authentication with a traditional AD Account

Login using a local account created on the Virtual machine in question using the portal or CLI. Use the format {DOMAIN}\\{USERNAME} for the username when logging in.

Pre-requisites:

- An Azure AD Account that has the following RBAC permissions:
    - Reader role on the virtual machine.
    - Reader role on the NIC with private IP of the virtual machine.
    - Reader role on the Azure Bastion resource.
- The VM is joined to a domain


# Notes and known issues

- File transfer is only supported using the Native RDP or SSH client, not through the Azure Portal directly.

- We've found this Windows GPO to cause issues with the file transfer if set to "enabled": 
    - `Computer Configuration \ Administrative Templates \ Windows Components \ Remote Desktop Services \ Remote Desktop Session Hosts \ Device and Resource Redirection \ Do not allow clipboard redirection`
