# New Spoke requests

Azure Landing Zone operates a Hub and Spoke architecture. A spoke is a container for one or more workloads. A workload is typically an application or group of related applications. All spokes must have at least one workload and a workload generally maps 1:1 with an Azure subscription. 

![ALZ Overview](../images/alz_spoke_workload_overview.png)

When requesting a brand new spoke, or expanding an existing spoke with an additional subscription/workload, this page can be used for reference to help you provide all of the relevant information to the ALZ team about this new set of resources.


## Checklist

### 1. Subscription

Have you already provisioned an Azure Subscription or would you like one to be created for you? If providing your own subscription, we'll need the correct RBAC assignments for our deployment tool service principals before we can start.

### 2. Location

The region that Spoke resources will be created in.

##### Example

UK South or UK West

### 3. Spoke or Workload identifier

A unique string that identifies the functionality hosted in the new spoke. Could be a specific application or project name. We define and build new spokes using IaC and this value is used to determine the name of a number of resources.

##### Example

`Spoke/Workload identifier: xwc`

Resulting resources:

```
Resouce Group: rg-xwc-core-001
VNET: vnet-xwc-core-001
Keyvault: kv-xwc-coremoj-001
Automation Account: auto-xwc-core-001

etc...
```

### 4. Environments

Which environments the resources will be created in, selected from the following:

| Environment        |
|--------------------|
| Development        |
| NLE/Pre-Production |
| Production         |

We require a minimum of `Development` and `Production`, but NLE/Pre-Production can be added if required.


### 5. Tags

Tags are our primary means of identifying the owner and purpose of each resource, as well as feeding in to our cost management and billing logic. At a minimum we require tags for the following: 

| Mandatory Tags     |
|--------------------|
| application        |
| business_area      |
| owner              |



### 6. Network Address Spaces

Details on the address spaces you require for your core VNET and Subnets within it. This should be ununsed network space reserved in IPAM.

##### Example

| Resource           | Address space |
|--------------------|---------------|
| vnet-xwc-core-001 | 10.0.0.0/24    |
| snet-xwc-core-001 | 10.0.0.0/25    |
| snet-xwc-app-001  | 10.0.0.128/25  |




### 7. Extras

Anything additional not captured in the above. This is open ended and can include things like:

- Extra VNets and Peerings, for example:

| Source VNET           | Destination VNET(s) |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| vnet-xwc-core-001     | vnet-up-app-001     |


- Additional communication/network requirements outside of ALZ: DXC, AWS etc...
- Custom roles
- Specific VNet DNS forwarding (ALZ defaults to DNS servers maintained by Core Network Team)
- Service Accounts
- Policy exemptions
- etc...
