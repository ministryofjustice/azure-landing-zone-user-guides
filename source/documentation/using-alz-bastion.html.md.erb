# Using ALZ Bastion

The ALZ Bastion Host allows access to any Virtual Machine or Virtual Machine Scale Set in the Azure Landing Zone from the comfort of your own device.

There are two ways of accessing ALZ Bastion:

- Portal
- Native Client


## Portal

To connect to a Windows Virtual Machine via RDP, see this [Document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-connect-vm-rdp-windows#rdp)

To connect to a Windows Virtual Machine via SSH using username/password authentication (not recommended), see this [Document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-connect-vm-ssh-windows#username)

Connection to a Windows Virtual Machine via SSH using a private key can be done in various ways:

- [Pasting private key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-connect-vm-ssh-windows#privatekey)
- [Using private key from local file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-connect-vm-ssh-windows#ssh)
- [Using private key from Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-connect-vm-ssh-windows#akv)

Note, that while the documentation refers to windows virtual machines, ssh authentication would work exactly the same way for Linux virtual machines

## Native Client

If you are connecting from a Windows machine to a windows virtual machine see
[this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/connect-native-client-windows#connect-windows).

If you are connecting from a Windows machine to a Linux virtual machine see [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/connect-native-client-windows#connect-linux)

If you are connecting from a *nix machine to a Windows/Linux virtual machine see [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/connect-native-client-windows#connect-tunnel)

## Connection scenarios

### Authentication with a local account

Login using a local account created on the Virtual machine in question using the portal or CLI.

Pre-requisites:

- An Azure AD Account that has the following RBAC permissions:
    - Reader role on the virtual machine.
    - Reader role on the NIC with private IP of the virtual machine.
    - Reader role on the Azure Bastion resource.


### Authentication with an Azure AD Account

Login using your Azure AD account using the portal or CLI. **Please note this only currently works in Production.**

Pre-requisites:

- An Azure AD Account that has the following RBAC permissions:
    - Either Virtual Machine Administrator Login or Virtual Machine User Login role on the virtual machine
    - Reader role on the NIC with private IP of the virtual machine.
    - Reader role on the Azure Bastion resource.
