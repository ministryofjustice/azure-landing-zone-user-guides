# Azure landing Zone in ServiceNow

The Azure Landing Zone team managed incidents in ServiceNow. If an incident is deemed to be an issue with the Azure Landing Zone, it is likely to be a [major incident](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?sys_kb_id=8038660cdbea67401b4ffc45ae9619fa&id=kb_article_view&sysparm_rank=6&sysparm_tsqueryId=2e4d458c1b6d4550b51fdce3b24bcb62) and will be managed as such.

Our service offer in ServiceNow is *Azure landing Zone (MOJO)*

Our assignment group is *ALZ 4LS*

If you have general enquiries you can contact us (TBC)

#First, Second and Third Line Support Information

1LS, 2LS and 3LS teams have no responsibility towards managing ALZ but there may be cases which are caused by an issue in the ALZ. The ALZ has no 'direct' users; No one is going to call the help desk and say, “I’ve got an issue with or I can’t log into the Azure Landing Zone“. There may be times when 3LS staff require direct support with the ALZ.

##Incidents
If one user or a small subset of users have an issue with an application then it is likely to be an application issue and, therefore, not for the ALZ team.
If the issue is impacting all application users then it “could” be an Azure Landing Zone issue. Azure Landing Zone is dependent on the underlying networks so issues may be a Network failure.
