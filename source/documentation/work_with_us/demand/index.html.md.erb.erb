# How to make a request for work

Requests for new requests, or changes to existing spokes/workloads, which need to be completed by the ALZ team (e.g. network peering or new spokes) go through the Technology Services Demand process. 
Please contact them via their sharepoint site [Technology Services Demand function](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/sites/DemandandBusinessRelationshipManagement)
or by e-mailing [TS-Demand@justice.gov.uk](mailto:TS-Demand@justice.gov.uk)
