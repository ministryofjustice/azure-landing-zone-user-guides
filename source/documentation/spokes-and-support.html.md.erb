# Spokes and Support

## What does the Azure Landing Zone team provide as part of your spoke? 

All spokes are set up as fully compliant to Azure Policy. When we hand your spoke over as ready to use, this will include: 

### All spokes

- Networking to the hub, shared services and other requested destinations (which can include within Azure , outside of Azure ( i.e. internet ) or towards AWS , DXC and other connected MOJ environments)  
- Patching infrastructure (operating system level, only) which you opt into by tagging your resources appropriately 
- Key vault 
- Recovery services vault 
- Two storage accounts for logging 

### Optional

Additional elements of your spoke which we can provide include:  
   
- [Support setting up bastion access to your infrastructure](/documentation/using-alz-bastion.html)
- [Monitoring set up support] (/documentation/using-alz-monitoring.html)

### On our roadmap

Things that are on our roadmap to provide in the future are: 

- An example GitHub repo where the code for your spoke is stored 
- An example Azure DevOps project which will manage deployment pipelines for your spoke and resources 
- <del>Terraform Virtual Machine (VM) Creation module to use when spinning up new resource</del> [Available October 2022](/documentation/building-alz-vms.html)


### What do the Azure Landing Zone team support in your spoke? 

We will provide support for any elements provided as part of spoke handover and for any of our standard services that you have opted into using after handover. Examples of issues and requests we would help with are: 
 
- A VM application (app) or database (DB) fails to connect with another endpoint which has been configured 
- Our patching service is not using the patch arrangement we have setup e.g.  automation accounts and update management 
- You are unable to provision resources because of a policy violation e.g. name is not as per naming policy, trying to use a public IP address 
- Approved policy exemption implementation 
- You need to add a new route or peer from ALZ to somewhere 
- VMs that refuse to behave despite 3LS best efforts 
- You are unable to connect to your resources using our Bastion service 
- You no longer see monitoring traffic when using our solution in Prometheus 

**We do not support with any application level issues.** Please follow the established channels for reporting and resolving these (generally via ServiceNow).
